📚 College OS

College OS is an offline-first Android application that centralizes a student’s entire academic life into one unified system, with intelligent assistance built in the background.

It replaces scattered tools like notes apps, planners, attendance trackers, and reminders with a single, cohesive platform designed for college students.
